                    <span class='highlight-text'>About Us:</span> BarBets originated within the last year to provide a new and fun marketing tool for all sport bars. As bars are slowly welcoming customers back, we decided to come up with a way to make your bar stand out. BarBets allows the bar owner to post promotions related to sporting events bringing in new customers for an exciting day or night.

                    <span class="highlight-text">How it works:</span> The administrative portal is a portal for bar owners to log on and post a promotion. The website allows the bar owner to get creative allowing you to offer a wager for a straight, parlay, over/under or a create your own bet.  Don't worry, the app will only allow the customer to confirm their wager after they pick a time for their reservation and will also allow you to put a minimum spend requirement on their reservation.

                    <span class="highlight-text">Over/Under Bet:</span> Allows the player to pick if there will be more or less runs/points/goals in that game.

                    <span class="highlight-text">Create Your Own Bet:</span> Allows the bar owner to make up whatever bet he wants (ex. Will Aaron Judge have more than 1 hit tonight? Will Patrick Mahomes rush for a touchdown?)  This makes for a good promotion when there is a big game on and you want to stand out from everyone else.

                    All prizes are strictly the owners choice! The easier the bet the smaller the prize.  Looking to challenge your customers? Make the bet more difficult and offer a bigger reward to truly put their sports knowledge to the test. Below are some examples of bets that have worked in preliminary trials.  
                        <ul>&bull; Who will score the <strong>first</strong> touchdown?</ul>
                        <ul>&bull; Who will hit the <strong>first</strong> homerun tonight? (Bet is a loss if no one hits a homerun)</ul>
                        <ul>&bull; What will the final score be?</ul>                   
                </p>

            <div className="aboutUs__elem">
                <p>
                    These bets are more difficult so the prize might be more rewarding which will intrigue more people to come in and play!
